# ibm\_compute_vm_instance

Import the details of an existing VM instance as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm_instance" {
  hostname    = "jumpbox"
  domain      = "example.com"
  most_recent = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `hostname` - (Required, string) The hostname of the VM instance.
* `domain` - (Required, string) The domain of the VM instance.
* `most_recent` - (Optional, boolean) If there are multiple VM instances, you can set this argument to `true` to import only the most recently created instance.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier of the VM instance.
* `datacenter` - The data center in which the VM instance is deployed.
* `public_interface_id` - The ID of the primary public interface.
* `private_interface_id` - The ID of the primary private interface.
* `cores` - The number of CPU cores.
* `status` - The VSI status.
* `last_known_power_state` - The last known power state of a VM instance, in the event the instance is turned off outside the information management system (IMS) or has gone offline.

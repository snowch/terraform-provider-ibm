# ibm\_compute_vm_instance

Provides a resource for VM instances. This allows VM instances to be created, updated, and deleted.

For additional details, see the [Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) API docs](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest).

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create a VM instance using a Debian image:

```hcl
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "twc_terraform_sample" {
    hostname = "twc-terraform-sample-name"
    domain = "bar.example.com"
    os_reference_code = "DEBIAN_7_64"
    datacenter = "wdc01"
    network_speed = 10
    hourly_billing = true
    private_network_only = false
    cores = 1
    memory = 1024
    disks = [25, 10, 20]
    user_metadata = "{\"value\":\"newvalue\"}"
    dedicated_acct_host_only = true
    local_disk = false
    public_vlan_id = 1391277
    private_vlan_id = 7721931
    private_security_group_ids = [576973]
}
```

In the following example, you can create a VM instance using a block device template:

```hcl
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "terraform-sample-BDTGroup" {
   hostname = "terraform-sample-blockDeviceTemplateGroup"
   domain = "bar.example.com"
   datacenter = "ams01"
   public_network_speed = 10
   hourly_billing = false
   cores = 1
   memory = 1024
   local_disk = false
   image_id = 12345
   tags = [
     "collectd",
     "mesos-master"
   ]
   public_subnet = "50.97.46.160/28"
   private_subnet = "10.56.109.128/26"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `dedicated_acct_host_only` - (Optional, boolean) Specifies whether the instance must only run on hosts with instances from the same account. The default value is `false`.
     **NOTE**: Conflicts with `dedicated_host_name`, `dedicated_host_id`.
* `dedicated_host_id` - (Optional, integer) Specifies [dedicated host](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/vsi/vsi_dedicated.html) for the instance by its id.
     **NOTE**: Conflicts with `dedicated_acct_host_only`, `dedicated_host_name`.
* `dedicated_host_name` - (Optional, string) Specifies [dedicated host](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/vsi/vsi_dedicated.html) for the instance by its name.
     **NOTE**: Conflicts with `dedicated_acct_host_only`, `dedicated_host_id`.
* `os_reference_code` - (Optional, string) The operating system reference code that is used to provision the computing instance. To see available OS reference codes, log in to the [Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) API](https://api.softlayer.com/rest/v3/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest_Block_Device_Template_Group/getVhdImportSoftwareDescriptions.json?objectMask=referenceCode), using your API key as the password.
    **NOTE**: Conflicts with`image_id`.
*   `image_id` - (Optional, integer) The image template ID you want to use to provision the computing instance. This is not the global identifier (UUID), but the image template group ID that should point to a valid global identifier. To retrieve the image template ID from the SoftLayer Customer Portal, navigate to **Devices > Manage > Images**, click the desired image, and note the ID number in the resulting URL.

    **NOTE**: Conflicts with `os_reference_code`. If you don't know the ID(s) of your image templates, you can [refer to an image template ID by name using a data source](../d/compute_image_template.html).
*  `network_speed` - (Optional, integer) The connection speed (in Mbps) for the instance's network components. The default value is `100`.
*  `private_network_only` - (Optional, boolean) When set to `true`, a compute instance only has access to the private network. The default value is `false`.
*  `private_security_group_ids` - (Optional, array of integers) The ids of security groups to apply on the private interface.
*  `public_vlan_id` - (Optional, integer) The public VLAN ID for the public network interface of the instance. Accepted values are in the [VLAN doc](https://control.softlayer.com/network/vlans). Click the desired VLAN and note the ID number in the browser URL. You can also [refer to a VLAN by name using a data source](../d/network_vlan.html).
* `private_vlan_id` - (Optional, integer) The private VLAN ID for the private network interface of the instance. You can find accepted values in the [VLAN doc](https://control.softlayer.com/network/vlans). Click the desired VLAN and note the ID number in the browser URL.

* `private_subnet` - (Optional, string) The private subnet for the private network interface of the instance. Accepted values are primary private networks. You can find accepted values in the [subnets doc](https://control.softlayer.com/network/subnets).
* `disks` - (Optional, array of integers) The numeric disk sizes (in GBs) for the instance's block device and disk image settings. The default value is the smallest available capacity for the primary disk. If you specify an image template, the template provides the disk capacity.

* `file_storage_ids` - (Optional, array of numbers) File storage to which this computing instance should have access. File storage must be in the same data center as the bare metal server. If you use this argument to authorize access to file storage, then do not use the `allowed_virtual_guest_ids` argument in the `ibm_storage_file` resource in order to prevent the same storage being added twice.
* `block_storage_ids` - (Optional, array of numbers) File storage to which this computing instance should have access. File storage must be in the same data center as the bare metal server. If you use this argument to authorize access to file storage, then do not use the `allowed_virtual_guest_ids` argument in the `ibm_storage_block` resource in order to prevent the same storage being added twice.
* `post_install_script_uri` - (Optional, string) The URI of the script to be downloaded and executed after installation is complete.

* `public_bandwidth_unlimited` - (Optional, boolean). Allowed unlimited public network traffic(GB) per month for a monthly based server. The `network_speed` should be 100 Mbps. Default value: `false`.
    **NOTE**: Conflicts with`private_network_only` and `public_bandwidth_limited`.
